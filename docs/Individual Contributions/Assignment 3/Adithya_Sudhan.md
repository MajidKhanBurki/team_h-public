## Git flow to suit codesandbox.io
The problem with our prior strategy around using codesandbox.io was that team members ended up only uploading/pushing their code onto codesandbox.io when they were done developing locally. This is non ideal for two reasons: codesandbox.io offers the ability to develop code online directly, which can reduce development time and encourage frequent testing. By making the git process around this convoluted, I inadvertently pushed the team away from codesandbox.io for development. As team facilitator, I also did not get around to writing a full fledged wiki on the git process, which probably made the process daunting for more than 1 team member. Therefore, this warrants a re-think and a detailed walkthrough of how to approach codesabox.io with git. The following [explanation](../../Team%20Processes/Git+CodeSandbox.md) is supposed to solve this problem.
